I'm a seasoned software developer with over five years of experience, during which I've had the privilege of working with a `location technology` company, an `edtech` startup, and an `adtech SaaS` company. My skillset is diverse, spanning from `delving deep` into intricate problems, understanding their inner workings, and devising effective solutions, to nurturing ideas from `infancy` into `fully-fledged products`. I've also taken on leadership roles, serving as the primary `point of contact` for particular product initiatives. I excel both when working `independently` and as a member within a `collaborative team`, consistently achieving the desired outcomes.

Beyond my professional journey, I am an avid `open-source` advocate and contributor, having made contributions to projects like `Lichess` and `Scala`. Additionally, I hold a keen interest in `competitive coding` and believe in `critical thinking` from `first principles` in order to solve problems. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me indulging my passions for chess and football.
