I designed and developed a platform to bridge the gap between faculty and students in assessing topic understanding. The software addresses the challenge faced by faculties in determining the comprehension level of students for specific topics taught in class. It provides real-time coverage of lecture topics, allowing students to rate their understanding. 

Faculty members can access the aggregate ratings, enabling them to gauge the effectiveness of their teaching. The platform also facilitates seamless communication and meeting scheduling between students and faculty. With built-in authorization checks, it ensures secure access to course materials and other relevant features. This software aims to foster better student-faculty interaction and facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the topics being taught.

This project was created, following the due dilligence of software engineering processes, from talking to customers and stakeholders, gathering requirements, to creating the software design along with the UML diagrams.
